# 🐍 snake-feeder

Welcome to **snake-feeder** – a highly scientific repository that exists **only to keep my GitHub contribution snake alive and well-fed.**

---

## 🚨 Disclaimer  
This repository does **absolutely nothing useful**.  
It's just a fun way to ensure my contribution snake stays happy and my contribution graph stays green.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Keep the 🟩 squares alive.
- Give my GitHub Snake something to munch on every day.
- Watch it crawl joyfully through my profile.

---

## 🔄 Daily Routine
Every day, the snake gets between **1 and 3 delicious snacks**.  
Each snack is lovingly logged like this:

> 2025-07-15 08:00:00: 🐍 snake got snack #1 <br>
> 2025-07-15 08:00:02: 🐍 snake got snack #2

## 📊 Contribution Snake
My daily snake-feeding ritual helps keep this graph moving!
