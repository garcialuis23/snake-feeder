# 🐍 snake-feeder

Welcome to **snake-feeder** – a highly sophisticated and very serious repository whose sole purpose is to **keep my GitHub snake alive and well-fed.**

## 🚨 Disclaimer  
This repository exists purely for fun and vanity.  
There is **no meaningful code** here, just daily commits to feed my contribution graph and make my snake 🐍 happy.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Keep the 🟩 squares green.
- Satisfy the hunger of the GitHub contribution snake.
- Enjoy watching it wiggle through my profile.

---

## 🔄 Daily Routine
Every day, this repo receives a small commit:  
> `chore: feeding the snake 🐍`

Because even virtual snakes need consistent snacks.

## 🐍 Final words
Remember:  
Not all contributions need to be serious...  
**Some are just for the memes.**

🖤 *Thanks for visiting!*
